		<h1 class="title">About Data for Afghanistan</h1>
		<p>
		At Data for Afghanistan, our mission is to democratize access to data on Afghanistan. 
    Despite the abundance of data generated on the country, much of it remains inaccessible to the public. 
    Everyone, from students to policymakers, should have the opportunity to learn about Afghanistan without any hassle. </p>

    <p>
    To achieve this, we curate credible data sources and identify the most important topics. 
    Utilizing state-of-the-art data visualization technologies, we present this information in a user-friendly format. 
    We adhere to open-access principles. We also share third-party, open-access data work 
    on Afghanistan to ensure that valuable information is available to all. </p>

    <p>
    We invite you to collaborate with us or consider yearly sponsorships to support our mission of making 
    data accessible and expanding our platform with new research and datasets. </p>
