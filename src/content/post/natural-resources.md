## 1. Agriculture

<div style="min-height:462px" id="datawrapper-vis-8p2qf"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8p2qf/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-8p2qf"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8p2qf/full.png" alt="The percentage of Afghanistan's gross domestic product (GDP) that is from agriculture. Agriculture
refers to the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting sector." /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>From 2001 to 2018, the agriculture sector's share of GDP plummeted from 54.1% to 22.0%, indicating a possible diversification of the economy away from agriculture.</li>
  <li>Despite challenges posed by COVID-19, the years 2021-2022 have shown stability in agricultureâ€™s contribution to GDP, remaining above 33%. </li>
</ul>

## 2. Food

<div style="min-height:492px" id="datawrapper-vis-Padmy"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Padmy/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-Padmy"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Padmy/full.png" alt="Cereal yield, measured as tonnes per hectare (T/ha) of harvested land. Production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only and excludes crops harvested for hay or green for food, feed, or silage and those used for grazing." /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Afghanistan's cereal yield has significantly increased from a low of 0.81 tonnes per hectare in 2000 to 2.25 tonnes per hectare in 2022, showcasing an impressive improvement in agricultural productivity over the past two decades.</li>
  <li>After fluctuating in the early 2000s, cereal yields have stabilized and consistently improved since 2010, with yields remaining above 2 tonnes per hectare in most years.</li>
  <li>The highest cereal yields on record were achieved in 2018 and 2022, both at 2.25 tonnes per hectare, indicating successful agricultural practices or favorable conditions in those years.</li>
</ul>
