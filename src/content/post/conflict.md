<ul>
  <li>US airstrikes and associated civilian deaths were alarmingly high in 2001, with 6,546 strikes and 3,027 civilian deaths. Although airstrikes significantly decreased to just 247 in 2020, sporadic spikes in civilian casualties — such as 552 in 2008 and 546 in 2019 — underscore the persistent and devastating impact on civilian lives.</li>
  <li>Despite an overall reduction in air strikes, civilian casualties did not always follow the same downward trend. For instance, 2019 saw over 2,400 airstrikes causing 546 civilian deaths, highlighting the continued vulnerability of civilians in Afghanistan. </li>
