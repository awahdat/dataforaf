## Afghanistan's progress on United Nations SDGs?

<div style="min-height:490px" id="datawrapper-vis-DtZPY"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DtZPY/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-DtZPY"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DtZPY/full.png" alt="The SDG Index Score and each goal's score for Afghanistan." /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Afghanistan's overall SDG Index score improved by nearly 10 points, from 38.3 in 2010 to 48.2 in 2023, reflecting progress in various sustainable development goals (SDGs). Notably, several goals saw increases of more than 10 points, including clean water and sanitation (from 25 to 51), affordable and clean energy (from 15 to 37), life on land (from 57 to 77), and industry/innovation/infrastructure (from 7 to 16). This indicates remarkable achievements in infrastructure, environmental sustainability, and access to basic services.</li>
  <li>Despite some progress, notable declines occurred in eradicating poverty, where Afghanistanâ€™s score dropped dramatically from 29 to 5, highlighting a worsening poverty situation. Similarly, eradicating hunger also saw a slight decline, dropping from 41 to 38, indicating persistent food insecurity issues in the country.</li>
</ul>
