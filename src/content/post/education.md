## 1. Completion rate

<div style="min-height:530px" id="datawrapper-vis-TgNOx"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TgNOx/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-TgNOx"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TgNOx/full.png" alt="This chart shows the completion rate of formal education for males and females in Afghanistan. The completion rate is the percentage of students starting the final grade of an education cycle, compared to the student population who should be entering that grade. The three cycles of education include primary (grades 1-6), lower secondary (grades 7-9), and upper secondary (grades 10-12)." /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>From 2011 to 2022, the upper secondary education completion rate nearly doubled, rising from 13.7% to 26.7%. This signifies an improvement in keeping more high school students through the 12th grade.</li>
  <li>The primary education completion rate peaked in 2015 at 54.5%, but it dropped to 44.2% by 2022. This decline highlights potential challenges in maintaining primary school completion rates. It is possible that young kids might not have the opportunity to complete through grade 6.</li>

## 2. Education attainment rate

<div style="min-height:301px" id="datawrapper-vis-3lhLV"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3lhLV/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-3lhLV"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3lhLV/full.png" alt="This chart shows educational attainment rates for males and females in Afghanistan. The educational attainment rate is defined as the percentage of the population with a specific level of education or higher. " /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>The educational attainment rate for high school degrees or above peaked at 13% in 2020 but saw a significant dip in 2021 (9.5%) before recovering to 12.6% in 2022. It might be that political instability in 2021 was related to a decrease in the educational attainment rate.</li>
  <li>The percentage of people with a bachelor's degree or higher more than doubled from 1.9% in 2014 to 4% in 2022, showing a growing number of Afghans achieving higher education in recent years. The dip of 1.2% in 2021 was probably related to political instability that year.</li>

## 3. Out-of-school rate

<div style="min-height:484px" id="datawrapper-vis-Msi9B"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Msi9B/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-Msi9B"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Msi9B/full.png" alt="The percentage of Afghan male and female youth in the official age range who are not enrolled in upper secondary education. The upper secondary education includes grades 10 to 12." /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>The out-of-school rate for upper secondary students decreased significantly from 87.3% in 1974 to 51.5% by 2013, indicating an improvement in school attendance in the post-2000 era, highlighted by international aid and economic development in Afghanistan.</li>

## 4. Literacy rate

<div style="min-height:253px" id="datawrapper-vis-gfIM6"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gfIM6/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-gfIM6"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gfIM6/full.png" alt="This chart shows educational attainment rates for males and females in Afghanistan. The educational attainment rate is defined as the percentage of the population with a specific level of education or higher. " /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>The literacy rate for young people (ages 15 to 25) saw a rise from 30.1% in 1979 to a peak of 64.3% in 2015, reflecting access to education for younger generations. However, it dropped to 55.9% by 2021, indicating setbacks due to political and economic instability.
</li>
  <li>The literacy rate for adults aged 25 and above increased from 18.2% in 1979 to 37.3% in 2021. Despite this progress, a significant portion of Afghanistan's older population remains illiterate, highlighting the need for education opportunities for adults.</li>

## 5. Government spending

<div style="min-height:466px" id="datawrapper-vis-MDKsG"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MDKsG/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-MDKsG"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MDKsG/full.png" alt="Afghan government's spending on schools, teachers, and other educational needs, expressed as a percentage of Afghanistan's total income." /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Government spending on education saw a major jump in 2006, reaching 4.68% of GDP, compared to less than 2% during the 1970s and 1980s. Investment in education increased with Afghanistan's reconstruction efforts.</li>
  <li>After peaking at 4.81% in 2009, education spending as a share of GDP dropped to 3.26% in 2015 before increasing to 4.5% in 2016. These changes highlight inconsistent government spending in education which could undermine access to education in Afghanistan.</li>

## 6. Students per school & teacher

<div style="min-height:542px" id="datawrapper-vis-VRu1M"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VRu1M/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-VRu1M"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VRu1M/full.png" alt="The average number of students per school and teacher in Afghanistan from 2002 to 2022" /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>The number of students per school in Afghanistan has varied over the years. In 2004 and 2006, the number of students per school was the highest in the data (655 and 649, respectively). However, this number has been below 600 since 2008, signaling efforts to distribute students more evenly across educational facilities.</li>
  <li>The number of students per teacher in Afghanistan shows a slightly upward trend from 2002 to 2022. The period from 2010 to 2016 saw consistently high student numbers per teacher, reflecting the growing demand for education, exceeding the pace of new teacher recruitment. After 2015, there was a slight decline in the student-teacher ratio. The overall trend suggests that Afghanistan's education system has struggled to keep up with the growing student population, leading to larger class sizes.</li>

## 7. Schools

<div style="min-height:473px" id="datawrapper-vis-kMaL0"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kMaL0/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-kMaL0"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kMaL0/full.png" alt="Government and private schools in Afghanistan, 2002 to 2022" /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>From 2002 to 2022, the number of government schools grew substantially from 6,870 to 15,164, highlighting investments in public education infrastructure. Rapid growth in government schools took place between 2007 and 2011, i.e., increasing from 9,017 to 13,556. However, the growth has been gradual since 2011.</li>
  <li>Private schools in Afghanistan experienced significant growth, increasing from 159 in 2009 to 2,846 by 2022, reflecting the expanding role of private education. The private education sector experienced its sharpest growth from 2010 to 2012, followed by a noticeable growth in 2021 relative to 2019. While government schools' growth tapered off from 2011 to 2022, private schools' growth intensified.</li>
