## 1. Poverty

<div style="min-height:471px" id="datawrapper-vis-eaG3R"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eaG3R/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-eaG3R"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eaG3R/full.png" alt="The estimated percentage of Afghanistan's population living below the national poverty line of US$2.15 per day, using 2017 purchasing power parity (PPP)." /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Afghanistan has seen a rapid increase in poverty, with the poverty ratio increasing from 26.47% in 2013 to a staggering 65.16% in 2024. This alarming trend reflects the deepening economic crisis and its impact on the population, with more than half of Afghans now living below the poverty line.</li>
  <li>Between 2021 and 2024, Afghanistan's poverty ratio skyrocketed from 44.13% to 65.16%. This steep increase highlights the severe economic challenges faced by the country, likely exacerbated by political instability, unemployment, and lack of international aid.</li>

## 2. Unemployment

<div style="min-height:462px" id="datawrapper-vis-wLcQY"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wLcQY/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-wLcQY"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wLcQY/full.png" alt="The estimated percentage of Afghanistan's labor force without work but available and actively seeking employment. The labor force estimation includes individuals aged 15 and above." /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Afghanistan's unemployment rate has shown a consistent upward trend, rising from 7.91% in 2013 to 16.34% in 2024. The doubling of the unemployment rate over a decade underscores the challenges in the labor market and the need for robust economic policies to create jobs.</li>
  <li>The unemployment rate in Afghanistan jumped from 12.08% in 2021 to 16.34% in 2024. This sharp increase suggests a deteriorating economic environment, with more Afghans struggling to find employment amid growing uncertainties.

<div style="min-height:471px" id="datawrapper-vis-TiOF7"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TiOF7/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-TiOF7"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TiOF7/full.png" alt="Modeled estimate of the proportion of the female population aged 15 years and older that is economically active, divided by the same proportion for men." /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>The ratio of female-to-male labor force participation in Afghanistan has seen a sharp decline in recent years, plummeting from 21.84% in 2021 to just 6.99% in 2023. This sharp drop indicates a growing disparity, with far fewer women participating in the workforce compared to men.
</li>
  <li>The ratio, which measures the percentage of working-age women actively engaged in the workforce compared to men, had been gradually increasing from 19.25% in 2000, peaking at 28.94% in 2017. However, this trend reversed after 2017, reflecting increasing challenges for women to enter or remain in the workforce.

## 3. Life Satisfaction

<div style="min-height:458px" id="datawrapper-vis-npCJK"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/npCJK/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-npCJK"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/npCJK/full.png" alt="Subjective self-evaluation of life, where respondents are asked to evaluate where they feel they stand on a ladder where 0 represents the worst possible life and 10 the best possible life. Circle sizes represent the unemployment rate (%)." /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Afghanistan has experienced a sharp decrease in self-reported life satisfaction over the years. The life satisfaction score dropped from 4.76 in 2010 to a low of 1.28 in 2022, reflecting life dissatisfaction among Afghans. In fact, the life satisfaction score has never been above 5 over the years.</li>
  <li>The data suggests a potential correlation between rising unemployment rates and decreasing life satisfaction. As unemployment increased from 7.93% in 2008 to 15.38% in 2023, life satisfaction scores fell from 3.72 to 1.45, highlighting the relationship of economic instability with the well-being of Afghans. Other socioeconomic factors may also be related to life satisfaction, needing further investigation.
</li>
