" /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>The percentage of Afghanistan's population having access to basic drinking water services has seen a significant rise from 27.44% in 2000 to 82.18% in 2022, marking nearly a threefold increase. This substantial progress highlights ongoing efforts over two decades to improve essential water infrastructure.</li>
  <li>For the first time in two decades, more than 80% of Afghanistan's population had access to at least basic drinking water services in 2022. This milestone reflects crucial advancements in clean water access, public health, and development initiatives across the country.
</li>
</ul>

## 2. Sanitation Use

<div style="min-height:471px" id="datawrapper-vis-pGj5Q"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pGj5Q/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-pGj5Q"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pGj5Q/full.png" alt="The percentage of the population using at least a basic sanitation service, such as an improved sanitation facility that is not shared with other households. " /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>The percentage of the Afghanistan's population with access to basic sanitation services has increased from 20.97% in 2000 to 55.95% in 2022. Although the growth is slower compared to water services, it represents more than a doubling of access over 22 years, underscoring the gradual but steady improvement in sanitation infrastructure.</li>
  <li>In 2019, Afghanistan crossed an important threshold where more than half of the population (51%) had access to basic sanitation services. This marks a significant step in public health and the betterment of living conditions across the country.
