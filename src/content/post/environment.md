## 1. Air Pollution

<div style="min-height:506px" id="datawrapper-vis-lia5T"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lia5T/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-lia5T"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lia5T/full.png" alt="Air pollution measured as the population-weighted mean annual concentration of PM2.5 for the urban population in a country. PM2.5 is suspended particles measuring less than 2.5 microns in aerodynamic diameter, which are capable of penetrating deep into the respiratory tract and can cause severe health damage. Exposure is measured in micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter (µg/m³)." /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Over the 22 years from 2000 to 2022, Afghanistan's exposure to particulate matter has shown considerable fluctuation, with no consistent downward trend. This indicates ongoing challenges in managing air pollution, with significant variability that could be influenced by both natural and human-induced factors.</li>
  <li>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that annual average concentrations of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³). </li>
  <li>Levels of 35 µg/m³ or higher for 24 hours can cause problems for people with pre-existing health conditions issues like asthma.</li>
  <li>Long-term exposure to PM2.5 levels above 10 µg/m³ is associated with increased mortality rates, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and lung cancer.</li>

## 2. Natural Disasters

<div style="min-height:422px" id="datawrapper-vis-LuzUv"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LuzUv/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-LuzUv"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LuzUv/full.png" alt="Vulnerability of Afghanistan to different natural disaster events from 2016 to 2023." /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Flooding remains a consistent natural disaster in Afghanistan, with significant fluctuations in frequency. The number of flooding events peaked at 536 in 2022, followed by a sharp decrease to 234 in 2023.
</li>
  <li>While generally low in occurrence, snowfall events reached a peak of 143 recorded events in 2017, indicating a rare and significant weather anomaly during that year.</li>
  <li>Afghanistan faced a dramatic increase in earthquake frequency, rising from just 17 events in 2016 to an alarming 443 in 2023. This spike indicates a significant escalation in seismic activity over the past few years.</li>

<ul>
  <li>The number of fatalities due to natural disasters has escalated dramatically, with 1432 people killed in 2023, a stark rise from 163 in 2016. This alarming trend underscores the growing severity and impact of natural disasters in Afghanistan.</li>
  <li>The number of individuals and families affected by natural disasters has also seen a significant increase. In 2023, 344,625 individuals and 55,833 families were affected, marking the highest numbers in the observed period and reflecting the broader impact of disasters on the Afghan population.
</li>
  <li>The number of houses affected by natural disasters peaked in 2023, with 54,582 homes damaged or destroyed. This represents a significant increase compared to previous years, highlighting the extensive damage and potential displacement caused by these events.</li>

The average is calculated by dividing total affected individuals by total natural disaster events from 2016 to 2023." /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>The average number of individuals affected per event varies widely across Afghanistan. Provinces like Badghis (1,342) and Farah (1,321) have experienced significantly higher average impacts per event compared to provinces such as Ghor (98) and Kunar (82).
</li>
  <li>Provinces like Hilmand (963) and Kandahar (937) also show high average impacts, reflecting the intense vulnerability of these southern and western regions to natural disasters.</li>
  <li>The province of Parwan, with 180 average individuals affected per event, stands as the median. Badghis has the highest average at 1,342, while Kunar has the lowest at 82. The median is found by ordering the provincial impact values and identifying the middle value.</li>

<br />
<ul>
  <li>The average number of houses affected per event varies considerably across provinces. Badghis (209 houses) and Hilmand (129 houses) show the highest averages, indicating that these provinces are particularly vulnerable to disaster-related house damage. Provinces like Farah (123 houses) and Kandahar (126 houses) also report high averages.
</li>
  <li>The province of Nimroz, with an average of 34 houses affected per event, represents the median. Badghis has the highest average with 209 houses, while Daykundi experiences the least impact, averaging only 5 houses affected per event. The median is found by ordering the provincial impact values and identifying the middle value.</li>

## 3. Precipitation

<div style="min-height:1105px" id="datawrapper-vis-hoBXe"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hoBXe/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-hoBXe"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hoBXe/full.png" alt="Provincial average annual precipitation in Afghanistan since 1950." /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Most provinces show a gradual decline in average annual precipitation from the 1950s–1970s to the 2000s–2020s, indicating a broad intensification of drought conditions over time. The decline is particularly noticeable in southern and western provinces such as Hilmand, Kandahar, Farah, Nimroz, Uruzgan, and Hirat, where already low rainfall levels have fallen further in recent decades.</li>
  <li>Eastern and northeastern provinces consistently receive the highest rainfall, with Kunar and Nuristan standing out as the wettest, followed by Khost, Nangarhar, Paktya, Laghman, and Badakhshan. </li>
  <li>The driest conditions are persistently observed in the southwest and south, especially Nimroz, Hilmand, Farah, Kandahar, and Zabul, where average annual precipitation often remains below 20–25 mm in recent decades. These provinces exhibit both low baseline rainfall and limited recovery over time, making them more vulnerable to chronic drought.</li>

## 4. Temperature

<div style="min-height:1105px" id="datawrapper-vis-uyx0P"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uyx0P/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-uyx0P"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uyx0P/full.png" alt="Provincial average annual temperature in Afghanistan since 1950." /></noscript></div>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Looking at provincial average annual temperatures from 1950-2023, provinces in the southern, western, and central parts of Afghanistan have become relatively hotter. This increase in temperature is easily noticeable, with hotter years (darker shades) appearing more frequently since the late 1990s.</li>
  <li>Since 1950, Afghanistan’s coldest conditions have persistently been concentrated in the northern and northeastern provinces, particularly Badakhshan, Panjsher, Nuristan, and Bamyan. </li>
  <li>Jawzjan, Kunduz, Kandahar, Farah, Hilmand, and Nimroz have been the hottest provinces since 1950.</li>
  <li>The following provinces have been facing relatively hotter years more frequently: Samangan, Logar, Paktya, Takhar, Paktika, Uruzgan, Faryab, Nangarhar, and Balkh.</li>
</ul>
